# Self_Driving_Car_Engineer_Project
My Projects code for Self Driving Car Engineer - Nanodegree at Udacity (2016) 

I am fortunate to have studied the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity. Being one of the earliest 
students in this brand new field is certainly challenging.
My background is in Mathematics and Statistics (BSc, University of Edinbrugh) as well as Design/CAD Modelling(Master Transportation and Car Deisgn, Milan). I am currently based in Macao. 

Project codes are split into several smaller projects, such as lane finding, traffic sign classifer and behavioural cloning etc.

Kind regards,

Gary
