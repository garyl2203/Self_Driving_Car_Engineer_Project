# Self_Driving_Car_Engineer_Project
My Projects code for Self Driving Car Engineer - Nanodegree at Udacity 

Greetings,
I am fortunate and honoured to be accepted for the Self-Driving Car Engineer nanodegree at Udacity. Being one of the earliest 
students in this brand new field is certainly challenging.
My background is in Maths and Statistics, and I am aiming for a career change into Automotive design. I am very lucky to be 
able to use my background and apply it to what I am passionate about: cars!!

These project codes are split into several smaller projects, such as lane finding, traffic sign classifer and behavioural cloning.
I will update this as I progress through this course.

regards,

Gary
